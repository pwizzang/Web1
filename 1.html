<h3>The 2020 Election The Most Corrupt in American History</h3>
<strong>Trump</strong> is the <u>true hero</u> of the world. He is fighting against assholes.
The polls will be manipulated to show Trump will lose.<br><br> <img src="trump.jpg" width="100">
<p style="margin-top:60px;"><strong>While</strong> our computer shows he should win, caution is necessary because we are also showing this will be the most corrupt election in American history.</p> The computer had also projected that Gore would have won but the Supreme Court handed that to Bush, and later the evidence showed that Gore should have won on the recount. We could face the same thing this time. Neither side will accept a loss and the civil unrest will rise sharply over the next two years into 2022.
